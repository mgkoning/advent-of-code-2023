# advent-of-code-2023
My solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Language
Initially authored in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). See the [sub-README](rust/aoc2023/README.md)
for more information.

## Inputs
Inputs are not part of the repository (as per request of the organizers of Advent of Code).
They should be placed in the `input` directory using the name format `day00.txt`, as this path and
format is hard-coded in the application.
